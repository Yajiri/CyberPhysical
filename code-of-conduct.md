# Code of Conduct

## 1. Collaboration Plan
- Meetings are compulsory to attend, and most of them will be on campus.
- If a team member is unable to attend, they must inform the group the day before, unless it is an emergency.
- A team member may submit opinions to the meeting prior to it occurring if they know they will not attend and have informed the group.
- We will work to distribute work evenly, with consideration for individual skill levels.
- We will strive to meet hard deadlines, and if someone is having trouble meeting a deadline, they should inform the group in advance, so other members can support them.

## 2. Individual Contributions
- Individual contributions are documented through frequent commits so that they can be referred to at any time.
- Individual contributions can be mentioned on Discord or preferably in meetings.
- Team members are encouraged to keep a personal log of daily work

## 3. Knowledge Transfer
- We will conduct meeting stand-ups to ensure that everyone stays up to date.
- If a team member is unable to attend, it's their responsibility to fill in what they did (on Discord).

## 4. Communication Plan
- We will use Discord as our main channel of communication.
- Meetings will be set up a few days in advance each week, and time will be allocated to plan and divide the work for each increment.

## 5. Conflict Resolution
We will assume each person takes responsibility for their work and adheres to a common set of rules such as:
- If a team member knows they will be unable to complete their tasks, it is their responsibility to inform the team, so that team resources can be allocated accordingly.
- If a team member feels like the workload is not distributed fairly, it is their responsibility to bring it up before the deadline of the respective feature/increment.
- We will behave respectfully towards each other. We will strive to help each other, to be open to asking questions, and to work collaboratively. We should aim to communicate earnestly so that everyone is well-aware of the situation.
- Interpersonal conflicts are solved in team discussions.
- If none of the above work, then we will contact the course responsible.
